// Edit distance
//Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, find the edit distance between the strings.
// Edit Distance of two strings is minimum number of operations required to make one string equal to other. 
// In order to do so you can perform any of the following three operations only :
// 1. Delete a character
// 2. Replace a character with another one
// 3. Insert a character

// Edit Distance memoization


// Edit distance DP
int editDistance(string s1, string s2) {
	int m = s1.size();
    int n = s2.size();
    int dp[m][n];
